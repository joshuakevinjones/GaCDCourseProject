# ReadMe File - Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

This codebook is intended to satisfy the course project requirement to create a ReadMe file that explains:
  - the nature of the course project
  - the steps taken to complete the course project
  - Anything extra you need to run the run_analysis.R file

## Course Project Instructions
You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Good luck!

## What I did to complete the course project:

- Downloaded all course files to a specific folder on my hard drive
- Set that folder as the working directory with the setwd() command in R 
- Ran the function to create the cleaned data set specified in the course project requirements
